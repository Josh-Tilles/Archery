(* This should be mostly "plain" HOL, rather than being really CategoryTheory-heavy. *)

(* MAYBE: prove that \<lambda>n.n+1 is "onto", whereas the squaring function isn't. *)

(* @TODO create an exercise for the g.f = h.f --> g=h for surj functions *)

(* one-to-one & monomorphism *)

(* the mirror of a monomorphism is an epimorphism *)

(* "epi-mono factorization?" *)
